### Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today.  
We can’t be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it’s fate that today is the 4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution but from annihilation.

### We’re fighting for our right to live
to exist, and should we win today the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice.

##“We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. We’re going to live on. We’re going to survive. Today we celebrate our Independence Day!”
